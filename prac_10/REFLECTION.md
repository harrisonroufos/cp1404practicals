# Reflection

### Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

My accuracy on estimating the time it would take me to complete a task at the start of the subject was
accurate but as the subject progressed and I ran into harder topics my estimate accuracy was quite off I thought 
it would take me quicker to complete tasks. Over the course of the subject my accuracy got better as I spent a lot more
time on newer topic tasks that I was learning.


### Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

From doing code reviews I have learnt more about reading and understanding code not just writing. It has also taught me 
different ways to implement the same code in a more concise way. And with my code being reviewed I have learnt on ways to 
reduce DRY (Don't repeat yourself).

#### 2 code reviews I have done.
- [Prac 5](https://github.com/hexhart/cp1404practicals/pull/2)
- [Prac 7](https://github.com/HenevianAcero/cp1404practicals/pull/4)


### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

There is not much I would change in the practical tasks maybe I would add more tasks to do with reading and debugging code
but besides that I felt the tasks where very good and useful to my learning.
